Research is supported by about $17M per year in external funding. Research interests of CCBCR faculty focus on determining how signals transmitted by growth factors, cytokines and the extracellular matrix regulate aspects of tumor biology including the control of cell growth and tissue remodeling. Research questions relate to how mammalian cells initiate, integrate and respond to signaling cascades that are activated by growth factors, cytokines, mechanochemical stimuli and the extracellular matrix. Several laboratories focus on defining signaling cascades that effect changes in gene expression that regulate cell growth, differentiation, etc.",

Much of this work involves collaboration among investigators based at the School of Medicine, the School of Public Health, the School of Dental Medicine, and Boston Medical Center Hospital. Students have opportunities to participate at multiple levels; during funded summer research electives, during elective rotations of the advanced clinical clerkship year, and through the use of academic leaves of absence. The Office of Enrichment, within the Office of Academic Affairs assists students in developing project proposals and identifying faculty mentors. In recent years, approximately 50% of BUSM students have done significant research during their time in medical school.",

In 1873 Boston University acquired the buildings and endowment and the school name was changed to Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM). This school was one of the first to connect the study of medicine with the care of patients, integrating clinical practice, education, and research.  Boston Medical Center, our primary teaching hospital, is a primary, secondary, and tertiary care institution with a busy inpatient program and a large, full-service ambulatory teaching practice. This facility, along with other community-based health centers and hospitals, provides a varied and rich clinical experience for students.  BUSM and BMC have strong cultural and institutional commitments to serving all members of our society, and these commitments are apparent in our clinical, educational, and research programs.",

PRIME-LA is a five-year concurrent/dual degree program focusing on Leadership and Advocacy with the goal of developing leaders in medicine addressing policy, care and research in healthcare for the underserved. The dual degree program leads to an MD and a Masters in areas that complement the mission of the program. These might include MBA, MPH or Masters in Public Policy. The cohort will be composed of 18 students. Students will identify with one of two programs: PRIME-LA Westwood or PRIME-LA CDU. Each program will coordinate with the others but acceptance will be to PRIME-LA.  Applicants interested in obtaining a dual degree, who are not interested in PRIME-LA, should opt for and select the â€œRegular MD program.â€�",

Academic background—grades and grade trends, all MCAT scores, postbaccalaureate and/or graduate experiences, honors courses, research experiences and any independent study courses.\n\n   B.  Personal Growth and Development—maturity, integrity, leadership skills, empathy and interpersonal skills, involvement in activities helping others, exposure to diverse circumstances and settings, critical thinking skills, communication skills, and distance traveled (i.e., where the applicant has come from to where s/he/they are now).\n\n   C.  Professional Development—understanding of humanistic dimensions of medicine, exploration of medicine through physician shadowing, distance traveled, demonstrated experiences in health care and service-oriented settings, knowledge of medical school demands and pressures, research productivity, external vs. internal pressures to pursue a medical career.\n\nDecisions are communicated as soon as possible. Applicants are notified if they are accepted, placed on the Alternate List or denied acceptance within approximately two to four weeks.  Accepted applicants are required to respond to their Cincinnati Medicine offer within two weeks. The University of Cincinnati abides by the AAMC Traffic Rules and students may hold multiple acceptances until the stated date per the AAMC.

        "specialtyTrainingTxt": "Cincinnati Medicine offers a four-year comprehensive Career Development curriculum to guide and support our students through the process of finding a medical specialty and residency program that is right for them.\n\nWe follow the 4-phase model established by the AAMC \"Careers in Medicine\" program.  Beginning Orientation week, activities offered range from formal career talks that have been integrated into the curriculum to optional extra-curricular activities. We provide both sessions for the entire class and individual one-on-one meetings to ensure that students receive the key information they need, as well as personalized support. Below are some examples:\n\n1. Understand Yourself\n\nOrientation: An important step in the process is thoughtful self-assessment and self-awareness which begins with an Orientation week session on personality types and an overview of our Career Development curriculum.\n\nSelf-Assessments: Online self-assessment is completed the Medical Specialty Preference Inventory and Myers-Briggs Type Indicator to give them an initial idea of some specialties to begin exploring and learning styles.\n\nSummer Opportunities Week: A week is dedicated to educating M1 students on potential summer opportunities including research, service, clinical and global health opportunities. \n\n2. Explore Your Options\n\nM1/M2 Physician and Society Career Series: We have integrated a series of career development sessions including panels of physicians from different specialties and discuss the steps and timeline for applying to residency programs.\n\nMonthly Career Trivia Questions: To familiarize our students with career resources,we send out a monthly career trivia question with a raffle for a prize.\n\nDepartment Specialty Meetings: All departments hold their own specialty information meetings led by faculty physicians in that specialty, typically the clerkship director and/or residency program director to allow students to hear about their particular specialty and ask questions in a small group setting.\n\nStudent-led Specialty Interest Groups: groups meet throughout the year and coordinate lunch talks, workshops, shadowing and service opportunities for students.\n\n3. Choose Your Specialty\n\nM3/M4 Clinical Clerkships: Clinical clerkships during M3/M4 years offer students the opportunity to explore different specialties and develop relationships with faculty/residents in those specialties.\n\nM3 Individual Advising Appointment: students are assigned an M3 advisor and have individual meetings with that advisor. Topics covered during that individual meeting include the student’s background, transition to clinical clerkships and specialty interests.\n\nMeetings with Specialty Advisors: We compile a list of faculty advisors in different specialties to allow contact with additional advisors in varied specialties.\n\nCareers in Medicine Resources: To help with the process of choosing a specialty, students are directed to helpful resources, such as the Careers in Medicine Clinical Rotation Evaluation form and online Specialty Indecision Scale. Students are also encouraged to repeat the Medical Specialty Preference Inventory as they gain more clinical experience.\n\n4. Prepare for Residency\n\nM3 & M4 Class Meetings: To guide our students through landing a residency, a series of class meetings are held covering topics such as: planning your M4 schedule, the residency application, interviewing and more!\n\nM4 Individual Advising: Each student has individual appointments with an advisor in the Office of Student Affairs to discuss topics such as M4 schedule, specialty, recommendations and personal statement.\n\nMeetings with Specialty Advisors: Students work with faculty advisors to prepare their residency applications and receive guidance on which programs to apply to.\n\nResidency Mock interviews: To give M4 students a chance to practice before real residency interviews."

Early Selection is a highly competitive program for applicants with academic distinction, a proven commitment to medicine with an early foundation in clinical experiences, and an interest in including more humanities, liberal arts and other non-science courses in their academic experience.  Please note that there are minimum eligibility requirements to apply which include a minimum overall 3.5 GPA and no Cs or below in science coursework. Students apply to the Early Selection program during the second semester of their sophomore year as an undergraduate.

        "additionalInfo": "The Albert Einstein College of Medicine strives to matriculate a diverse group of outstanding students whose academic accomplishments, clinical experiences, community service and research indicate that they will become exceptional healers, educators, colleagues, patient advocates, scientists, role models and life-long learners. We are committed to identifying individuals who already have demonstrated the qualities of compassion, empathy, kindness, creativity, professionalism, leadership and maturity. A diverse student body is consistent with the history and mission of Einstein and supports a key educational objective to raise the cultural awareness and competence of our graduates.  \n\nMedicine is increasingly appreciated as a discipline that requires skills and abilities that are acquired through experiences and venues both inside and outside the classroom. Dr. Darrell G. Kirch, President and CEO of the AAMC has stated, \"Many students who would make excellent doctors are not extended an interview because admissions committees do not have ready opportunities to consider their broader personal characteristics before granting one.\" \n\nIn response and to prepare applicants for holistic review that will evaluate, equally, their personal characteristics and academic readiness for medical school, Albert Einstein College of Medicine has instituted a competency-based admissions process.  We believe, as Dr. Kirch has stated, that this approach \"will allow applicants the opportunity to demonstrate the complex personal dimensions that contribute to being a good doctor,\" in addition to the cognitive capabilities that have traditionally identified applicants as being ready for the academic rigor of medical school.  This \"competency-based\" approach also provides candidates greater flexibility, for example, by substituting laboratory experience gained, while employed, for laboratory and or course requirements taken in school, or by substituting online courses that free up time to pursue interests that enhance the applicant's level of maturity and readiness for the medical profession. \n\nThe Committee on Admissions will use the entire application to ensure that the candidate has demonstrated reasonable accomplishment of all of the identified competencies; this includes the AMCAS application, academic record, personal comments, roster of experiences, letters of recommendation, the Einstein secondary application, written and verbal communication with the Admissions Office, and interview (where applicable).\n\nThere are 4 competencies (which can be viewed in detail at: http://www.einstein.yu.edu/education/md-program/admissions/application-procedure/course-requirements.aspx): \n1.Co-Curricular Activities and Relevant Experiences \n2.Communication Skills \n3.Personal and Professional Development \n4.Knowledge \n\nWhereas course work at a four-year college or university is our benchmark, if a student chooses to meet a competency component via an alternate route such as through laboratory experience, through an advanced placement course, a course taken at a community college, a course taken abroad (during a semester abroad for which the undergraduate U.S. degree-granting institution gives credit, or for which AMCAS will verify and report the grade), or an online course, he or she should seek guidance from his or her advisor to ensure that the option meets the above guidelines as well as the rigorous academic standard required by the Albert Einstein College of Medicine.\n\nMCATS\nAll applicants must take the MCATs not later than September of the year preceding matriculation and not earlier than three years prior to application."

Until 1950, the college contributed nearly half of the black physicians in the United States. The 321-bed Howard University Hospital was completed in 1975. It is the college's primary teaching hospital for medical students and is used for postgraduate training in the various specialties of medicine. Medical students also may serve clerkships at the Children's National Medical Center, St. Elizabeth's Hospital and the Washington Veterans Affairs Hospital.",

        "additionalInfo": "The admissions process assesses each applicant for potential to become a successful physician. These attributes form the focus of student evaluation at the time of application and throughout their medical careers. Through adoption of the same core competencies used during residency training, our curriculum is integrated into the continuum of physician professional development. Successful physicians are skilled in six areas, so we look for the following attributes that reflect each of these areas at the time of admission.\n\n-Professionalism: Physicians have a unique contract with society that requires them to place the interests of patients above their own, maintain high standards of competence and integrity, and provide expert advice on matters of health. The admissions committee considers the personal statement, evaluation letters, and the interview to evaluate an applicant’s accountability and ethical responsibility. \n\n-Interpersonal and Communication Skills: Physicians must effectively communicate with a wide range of colleagues and patients. The admissions committee considers secondary application responses and interview to evaluate an applicant’s social and communication skills. \n\n-Practice-Based Learning and Improvement: Lifelong learning is a key skill which requires the ability to self-evaluate one’s knowledge and skills to identify areas for improvement. The admissions committee considers secondary application responses and interview to evaluate an applicant’s capacity for improvement.\n\n-Systems-Based Practice: As health care has evolved, a collaborative team of professionals is necessary to provide safe, effective, efficient, timely, patient-centered, and equitable care. The admissions committee considers secondary application responses and interview to evaluate an applicant’s understanding of health care systems and ability to collaborate toward a common goal. \n\n-Patient Care: At its heart, a medical career is a calling to serve our patients and communities. The admissions committee considers participation in community service, secondary application responses, and interview to evaluate an applicant’s understanding of this role and dedication to meeting the health care needs of others. \n\n-Medical Knowledge: The Kentucky Integrated Curriculum is a rigorous course of study that requires students to not only acquire knowledge, but also synthesize and apply that knowledge to each unique patient scenario. The admissions committee considers applicant grades and MCAT scores as evidence of success in challenging academic settings.\n\nIn the individual assessment of each applicant, the UKCOM prioritizes other attributes that reflect our mission. Although not essential, certain applicant characteristics will enhance potential to contribute to the college and to the medical profession:\n\n-Commitment to the State: As a state medical school, the UKCOM gives preference to Kentucky residents, and non-residents who have strong ties to the state, including previous attendance at a Kentucky college or university. \n\n-Commitment to Underserved Populations: Certain geographic areas (rural Appalachian counties) and patient populations (low socioeconomic status, underrepresented minority) have challenges in receiving safe, effective, patient-centered, timely, efficient, and equitable health care. The UKCOM values individuals who have demonstrated interest in serving these areas or populations."

This will be facilitated through partnerships that have been established with several local schools and community-based organizations.  \nFinally, the Miami Model for Health Professions Education will offer a sequence of initiatives from the high school to the undergraduate level that will enable more disadvantaged students to progress from one stage of the healthcare-education continuum to the next.  \nFor more information please contact us at Office of Diversity and Inclusion at (305) 243-7156 or using our contact form.\n\n\n",

By 1909, the university had organized several small medical colleges into a new medical school and, in 1948, the school was named in honor of Samuel Cardinal Stritch, Archbishop of Chicago.

In 2011, Loyola transferred its clinical and patient care operations to Trinity Health, one of the largest Catholic health systems in the United States, and also established a new Health Sciences Division to enhance the University's academic and research enterprise at the medical center campus.The campuses main buildings include: Stritch School of Medicine, Marcella Niehoff  School of Nursing, Loyola Center for Fitness, Cardinal Bernardin Cancer Center, and Loyola University Hospital.",

        "additionalInfo": "Medical school admissions requirements nationwide have remained unchanged for decades. While students who have achieved them performed well in medical school, these requirements have often burdened and even discouraged non-science majors from applying to medical school. Furthermore, they failed to convey the need to cover modern topics and impeded creativity in premedical education.\n\nAfter considering the ongoing transformation in medical school admissions, admissions requirements used by medical schools nationwide, and the type of applicant this medical school seeks to educate, an Admissions Task Force appointed by the vice dean of the School of Medicine concluded that: 1) it was in the best interest of this medical school to abandon the current list of prescribed courses; and 2) to afford applicants flexibility in meeting requirements for admission. Recommendations of the Admission Task Force were endorsed by the SOM Admissions Committee and approved by the Council of Deans.\n\nThe SOM employs a holistic admissions review that affords each applicant balanced consideration of life experiences, personal attributes and academic metrics to select not only those who can succeed but those who can contribute to the diversity of a medical school class that can serve as a driver of educational excellence. For further details, see Applicant Evaluation and Decisions on the Admissions website.\n\nThe School of Medicine offers pre-application counseling for prospective applicants and post-application counseling for unsuccessful applicants. To make an appointment, call the admissions office at (601) 984-5010.  The Admissions Office encourages all students who are interested in applying to our SOM to arrange for pre-counseling early in their undergraduate careers."

Our unique approach exposes students to a mix of basic science and clinical material presented in core subjects instead of the traditional presentation by department (e.g. anatomy, biochemistry, etc.).  In addition to large lectures, students benefit from small group learning sessions where they examine patient scenarios, discuss a variety of relevant topics and practice their clinical skills on patient simulators.\n\nStudents can participate in additional programs which provide in-depth study in a selected area of medicine.\n",

        "additionalInfo": "Pre-requisite coursework\nWe require that your undergraduate coursework has been completed at an accredited college or university within the U.S. or Canada and that your grades are documented in letter-grade format on your transcript and not pass/fail. Substitutions are not acceptable for any of the required courses and the science course work must be taken in a seated class.\n\nAcademic preparation should include the prerequisite courses listed on our website regardless of your field of study or advanced degree at http://www.med.unc.edu/admit/requirements/academic-requirements. Typically, the prerequisite courses are taken as a whole during an undergraduate program, alternatively others will take the prerequisite coursework after earning their four-year degree. Whichever path you choose, your degree and your prerequisite coursework must be satisfactorily completed within five (5) years prior to submitting an AMCAS application to our school. \n\nIf you are not within the five (5) year limit then you must do one of the following before applying:\n•\tRepeat the prerequisite science coursework (30 credit hours or more) -OR- \n•\tDemonstrate current mastery in the natural sciences by satisfactorily completing a graduate science program in the natural sciences  before applying to our medical school -OR-\n•\tComplete 30 credit hours or more in upper level science course work in Chemistry, Biology, Physiology, Physics, Microbiology, etc. before applying.  \nPlease note that CLEP credits are not accepted for required courses, and we do not accept verification from the World Education Services (WES) for the required coursework. \n\nGPAs \nYour GPA should reflect strong academic ability especially in the natural sciences. If your GPAs are significantly below the criteria on our website at: https://www.med.unc.edu/admit/requirements/admissions-process/, we strongly recommend that you consider a post-baccalaureate or science graduate program, in the natural sciences, and take at least 30 credit hours or more. This gives you the opportunity to show an improvement in your academic ability, and to prepare for graduate level coursework. Furthermore, it is important that your post-baccalaureate or graduate work be completed before applying, as this will enable us to consider and evaluate your success in the program. Remember, your goal is to demonstrate proficiency in the natural sciences, and only having a few credit hours of post-grad work on your AMCAS application will not give us the evidence that we need. \n \nReapplications\nApplications to UNC School of Medicine are limited to a total of four (4) cycles of application--the initial application plus three (3) re-applications. This applies to all applications submitted prior to the 2017 application cycle.\nAcceptance coursework and degree programs\n\nAcceptance into the UNC School of Medicine is contingent upon showing successful completion of all course work and degree granting programs indicated on your AMCAS application or described in your interview prior to matriculation.  Please remember that you must submit final official transcripts from each U.S. institution showing successful completion of coursework and degree programs by July 1st of the matriculating year.  \n\nDeferrals\nAdmitted students who have paid their enrollment deposits may request to be considered for a deferment of their matriculation no later than June 1st (we offer a limited number of deferments). The Deferral Committee will consider requests individually and will typically grant deferrals for research, academic programs--additional year of graduate studies--scholarship for medical internship or service programs. Deferrals are usually allowed for one year.  If you know that you will not be ready to matriculate into medical school prior to applying it is best to consider waiting until you are."

The purpose of the program is to expose future physicians to the scientific foundations of medicine and its practice through hypothesis-driven laboratory research.  NYU also offers students who are interested in prolonged research experiences, either independent study or through formal research programs, to participate in the Five-Year Program. Students can apply for a variety of research fellowships such as the Doris Duke Research Fellowship, the NIH Research Scholars Program, or the Sarnoff Fellowship.",

For over 175 years, NYU has trained thousands of physician-scientists who have enriched countless lives and helped shape medical history. NYU is among the nation's leaders in consistently producing physician graduates who go on to become full-time members of medical school faculties. Students train at Bellevue, the nation's first public hospital. NYU is a private university in the public service; the School of Medicine combines the best of modern biomedical science with a rich tradition of caring for all populations at the highest level of human achievement.  We are proud to offer every one of our MD students with full tuition-scholarships regardless of need to limit the costs of obtaining one's medical degree.  We are also the first medical school in the country to offer a Three-Year MD Program with acceptance into any one of our residency programs through the NRMP.",
        "missionStatement": "NYU School of Medicine has a threefold mission: the education and training of physicians and scientists, the search for new knowledge, and the care of the sick. The three are inseparable. Medicine can be handed on to succeeding generations only by long training in the scientific method of investigation and by the actual care of patients. Progress in medicine, which is medical research, must look constantly to the school for its investigators and to the patient for its problems, whereas the whole future of medical care rests upon a continuing supply of physicians and upon the promise of new discovery. The purpose, then, can only be achieved by endeavor in all three directions - medical education, research, and patient care - and they must be carried on simultaneously, for they are wholly dependent upon each other, not only for inspiration, but also for their very means of success.",

Here is some other useful information to consider:\n\nStarting with the 2019-2020 application cycle for fall 2020 matriculation, NYU School of Medicine will require all applicants to complete the Computer Based Assessment for Sampling Personal Characteristics (CASPer) situational judgement test prior to receiving interview consideration. Please visit https://takecasper.com/ for test date information or to sign up for CASPer.\n\nApplicants invited for interviews will undergo an eight station multiple mini interview (MMI) at NYU School of Medicine.  Please visit https://med.nyu.edu/education/md-degree/md-admissions/multiple-mini-interview/ for more information on what you can expect from our MMI.\n\nWe send out acceptances on a rolling basis, starting on October 15th. If accepted, we require a $100 deposit to secure your seat in the class that is refundable through April 30th of the year of your matriculation.\n\nStarting with the 2019-2020 admissions cycle, there are additional options available to the applicant by way of the AAMC.  Accepted applicants may select “Plan to Enroll” as early as February 19, 2019, indicating that NYU School of Medicine is your preferred option among your other acceptances as of that time; you may continue to hold multiple offers and remain on other waitlists. As of April 15, 2019, we expect that applicants hold no more than three acceptances and can remain on other waitlists. On April 30, 2019, an applicant whose first choice is NYU School of Medicine must indicate “Plan to Enroll” via AMCAS action; at that point, you must also withdraw from any other acceptances you may be holding although you may remain on waitlists.  Accepted applicants may select the “Commit to Enroll” action in AMCAS as early as April 30, 2019 and as soon as they are sure they would like to commit to matriculating at NYU; we ask you to indicate this action as early as possible. Once that option is selected, you must withdraw all other acceptance offers and remove yourself from all other waitlists. Please note that all accepted applicants must select the \"Commit to Enroll\" action in AMCAS no later than Monday, July 22, 2019 (21 days prior to matriculation on August 12th).  Applicants to the Three Year MD Program who plan to attend NYU School of Medicine must select the “Commit to Enroll” action in AMCAS no later than Monday, July 8, 2019 (21 days prior to matriculation on July 29). MSTP applicants who plan to attend NYU must select the “Commit to Enroll” action in AMCAS no later than Monday, June 10, 2019 (21 days prior to matriculation on July 1st). Failure to comply with these requirements will result in rescission of your acceptance to our school. If you are holding a position in our class and receive another acceptance offer after April 30th and prior to our July 22nd deadline (July 8th for the 3 Year Program and June 10th for MSTP ) you must notify us via email within 24 hours.  In this email you should indicate the amount of time you have to respond to the current offer.  If you decide to withdraw your acceptance, please do so as soon as possible through the AMP portal.\n\nShould you have any further questions, please review our website or email us at admissions@nyulangone.org"

Please note that numbers provided below by MSAR do NOT reflect your actual costs; they reflect tuition charges and total cost of attendance PRIOR to receipt of these full tuition-scholarships. For the 2019-2019 academic cycle, every MD student received at least $55,018 in scholarship support offsetting the tuition charge, resulting in a net cost of attendance to the student of no more than $27,108.  These scholarships are need-blind, are automatically given to all our MD students, and effectively make the school tuition-free. We also provide merit based and need-based scholarships in addition to our tuition-free program.

There are many more applicants who meet the qualifications for the study of medicine than can be admitted to an incoming class. Each applicant is subject to an individualized, balanced holistic review – weighing personal characteristics in equal measure with academic metrics and foundational experiences.\n\nThe committee strives to select those candidates who demonstrate proficiency in foundational competencies the School of Medicine believes are essential for success in medical school and professional practice. These include but are not limited to pre-medical knowledge, aptitude for patient care, interpersonal and communication skills, self-directed learning and improvement, professionalism, and knowledge of the healthcare system and current healthcare issues.\n\nThe applicant must also demonstrate evidence of the AAMC intra- and inter-personal competencies for entering medical students which include ethical responsibility to self and others; reliability and dependability, resilience and adaptability; capacity for improvement; service orientation; social skills; cultural competence; teamwork; and interpersonal and communication skills.\n\nIn addition, a candidate should have a college education that includes premedical science courses essential for medical school as well as a broad exposure to the humanities and social sciences. Academic competence to succeed in medical school is assessed by the applicant’s college record, including GPA and MCAT scores.\n\nAs a future medical student, an applicant must also demonstrate excellent observation and communication skills as well as the motor function and conceptual, integrative and quantitative skills required for the study of medicine. As a future physician, an applicant must have the physical capacity and emotional maturity to complete medical school and practice medicine independently."

The dual degree program consists of four years of medical school and a minimum of three years of graduate study (which occurs between the preclinical and clinical curricula) including dissertation research in an area of basic biomedical science leading to a PhD degree. The work must be conducted under the guidance of a funded clinical and/or basic science investigator who is a member of the Graduate Faculty. The program concludes with clinical studies during the final two years of medical school. Students will receive academic counseling and career guidance, and participate in special seminars and retreats designed to enhance the educational environment.

We train physicians and biomedical scientists, conduct medical research, and provide health services on a local, national, and international level.",
        "missionStatement": "Beyond the important objective of training physicians who are scholars of human biology, the School of Medicine strives to graduate physicians who manifest in their personal and professional lives an appreciation of humanistic medicine. We regard humanistic medicine as a constellation of ethical and professional attitudes, which affect the physician's interactions with patients, colleagues, and society. Among these attitudes are concern for the sanctity of human life; commitment to dignity and respect in the provision of medical care to all patients; devotion to social justice, especially regarding inequities in the availability of health care; humility and awareness of medicine's limitations in the care of the sick; appreciation of the role of non-medical factors in a patient's state of well-being or illness; and mature, well-balanced professional behavior that derives from comfortable relationships with members of the human family and one's Creator.",

The program provides early application privileges but does not guarantee acceptance to the School of Medicine; however, participation in this program and its challenging nature greatly increase students' likelihood of matriculation to medical school. Regardless of admission status, all scholars are required to take the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) and are expected to perform to the best of their ability. For undergraduate institutions other than Saint Louis University, please refer to the college's web site for more information. The Medical Scholars Program is not an accelerated program.",

As a REMS student, you are admitted to the University’s School of Medicine and Dentistry once you successfully complete your bachelor’s degree and pre-med core courses.  You will also work closely with highly respected faculty members, attend special events, gain hands-on experience in clinics and labs, and earn funding for summer research projects. A broad focus on liberal arts is encouraged through an emphasis on community engagement, active involvement in research and exploring your humanistic interests ( music, advocacy, arts and etc).  REMS students benefit from close mentorship and advising, access to the medical center through REMS connections and the latitude for international exploration.",

        "additionalInfo": "The AMCAS application is used as a preliminary admission screening by the College of Medicine at MUSC.  All applicants receive a supplemental application  requesting additional information.  There is a nonrefundable fee for processing this application; a few waivers are granted, but these are reserved for SC residents only.  Selection is based on a total evaluation of the application; however the academic background (highest MCAT score; cumulative undergraduate GPA) is used to determine who qualifies for interviews.  The students who meet an established cutoff of MCAT scores and GPAs are scheduled for three interviews.  In most cases, one of the interviews is with an outside physician (usually a graduate of MUSC) who practices medicine in a nearby community.  The other two are with MUSC Admissions Committee members, faculty, and/or student members of the Admissions Committee. Each interviewer rates a student on non-cognitive traits considered essential to becoming a good physician and accomplishments. The non-cognitive traits include principles, critical thinking skills, ego, motivation, cultural competency, and personality. The accomplishments that include leadership, volunteerism, clinical exposure to medicine, and letters of recommendation.  Diversity is assessed during interviews when Committee members determine whether the student has any type of added value - unique qualities or experiences that would enrich the medical class (cultural experiences, athletic/artistic achievement, work experiences, advanced terminal degrees/research, overcoming adversity, etc.).  After interviews the formula for the acceptance index is based on four components: highest MCAT score, cumulative GPA, average of the personality traits, and average of the accomplishments.  Additional points are added to a student's index if that student qualifies for any type of added value.\nStudents who apply Early Decision are interviewed at the beginning of the interview process (during the month of September).  These students are notified of a final status by October 1.  Those who are not admitted as Early Decision candidates are automatically moved to the regular MD applicant pool and are reviewed along with others applying to the regular program.  The interview process ends mid-March when the class is finalized.  An alternate list is ranked immediately following the final Admissions Committee meeting.  Students who are placed on the alternate list have a good chance of being admitted during late spring or early summer when withdrawals from the accepted class begin to occur.  Interviewed students who are not accepted or placed on the alternate list are sent rejection letters in late March.\nThe admissions process is explained to each student at the time of interviews.  Every student is advised to schedule a follow up  meeting to discuss their strengths and weaknesses if they do not get into the medical school."

In addition, the cost of living in Dallas is lower than many other major cities with available medical school programs. UT Southwestern has a robust scholarship program, and every student who is offered admission will be considered for an award. We also highly encourage students to apply for other types of aid, specifically by filing the FAFSA annually. Our dedicated and knowledgeable staff works directly with students to secure all available funding for their medical education. If borrowing is necessary, UT Southwestern can help you select the most advantageous and fiscally responsible loan programs. Many out of state students are offered a competitive scholarship, which also entitles them to pay tuition at the much lower in-state rate. It is extremely rare for a student to discontinue school at UT Southwestern for financial reason. ",

          "info": "The MD/MA in Urban Bioethics Program addresses today’s extreme inequalities of health and access to critical resources—inequalities that leave many urban dwellers and communities distinctly disadvantaged, disenfranchised and vulnerable. Offered through Temple’s Center for Bioethics, Urban Health & Policy, the program trains students in the ethics and values of health, healthcare delivery, and health law and policy that underlie such complex urban disparities. Graduates possess the practical skills, theoretical orientation and resources required to maximize care and to be innovators in research, care delivery, and policy and advocacy work—all pluses considering the rapidly changing healthcare environment. Students will complete the requirements for the MA concurrent with the medical school courses with no additional time necessary to complete the MA coursework.

Once received, our committee ensures there is a current MCAT score and then screens to decide to give a secondary application.  Once the secondary and letters of evaluations are received, a committee reviews to determine an interview.  We interview on Mondays and Fridays from September to January.  After the interview, our Executive Admissions Committee determines who will join the class.  We have a December and February wave of admissions; afterwards, candidates not admitted are placed on the waitlist.  Vanderbilt's goal is to utilize the waitlist to craft a class that reflects the mission of the school.  In the spring, admitted candidates attend Second Look Weekend, which provides these individuals the opportunity to learn more about Nashville and Vanderbilt.  Admitted students have a checklist that they can use to stay on track about immunizations, matriculation surveys, and other items.  As a reminder, admissions is contingent on a successful criminal background check and documentation of graduation from an accredited institution.  Internationally educated candidates can find the following website helpful: https://registrar.vanderbilt.edu/academic-records/international-degrees.php.  Candidates are strongly encouraged to reach out to Admissions to clarify any questions they may have."

The medical center is located in the heart of Charlottesville. The City of Charlottesville is home to a diverse and complex patient population, due, in part, to a refugee resettlement site through the International Refugee Committee since 1998. An international clinic is embedded within the health system. There is also a large migrant community, predominantly from South and Central America. There is a large catchment area which draws patients from borders of Tennessee and West Virginia through Southwest Virginia. Patients are seen in person as well as through Telemedicine - a national model. In 2019, a new bed tower, expanded emergency room and interventional radiology suite will add approximately 200 beds to the campus which includes a Cancer Center, Children's Hospital, Long Term Acute Care and Rehabilitation Hospitals.",

Applicants holding at least one acceptance from any medical school will have the option to “Plan to Enroll” in mid-February. \nPer WUSM Admissions policy, applicants who have been offered admission to WUSM and intend to matriculate at WUSM should indicate they “Plan to Enroll” through the Choose Your Medical School Tool as soon as possible, but no later than April 30th of the year in which they will matriculate. WUSM reserves the right to rescind offers of acceptance if an applicant has not selected “Plan to Enroll” by April 30th.   After April 30th, while an applicant maintains the “Plan to Enroll” status at WUSM, applicants may continue to hold positions on the waitlist of other schools.\nBeginning April 30, accepted applicants have the option to “Commit to Enroll” at WUSM. When an applicant selects “Commit to Enroll” to WUSM, they should notify all other institutions where they hold an acceptance or position on the waitlist that they wish to withdraw their acceptance or position on the waitlist from that school. WUSM reserves the right to rescind an offer of admission to any applicant still holding an active acceptance at another institution while having a “Commit to Enroll” status with WUSM. WUSM reserves the right to rescind offers of admission from any applicant still holding a WUSM acceptance while indicating that they either “Plan to Enroll” or “Commit to Enroll” at another institution after April 30th.   \nFor applicants accepted after April 30th, the timeline for selecting “Plan to Enroll” will be specified by the Associate Dean for Admissions.\nAll MD applicants planning to matriculate at WUSM should select the “Commit to Enroll” option no later than one week before the first day of orientation.\nShould an applicant have an extenuating circumstance preventing compliance with this policy, it is the applicant’s responsibility to notify the WUSM Admissions Office and seek an extension or exception."

In addition, the test must be completed prior to the interview.\n\nThe University of Washington School of Medicine does not accept applications from students who request to transfer from other medical schools unless the students are residents of Wyoming, Alaska, Montana or Idaho, (WAMI) and there is a funded position open in the respective state's contract due to student attrition. More information is available at: https://www.uwmedicine.org/school-of-medicine/admissions/transfer-advanced-standing \n\nApplicants are expected to comply with the following policies:\nHonor Code: The University of Washington School of Medicine believes that high ethical standards are essential to the practice of medicine. As we aspire to cultivate and maintain a community of professionalism and academic integrity, we place at the foundation of our endeavors and in all of our interactions the ideals of excellence, integrity, respect, compassion, accountability and a commitment to altruism. Through the Honor Code, we attempt to articulate the most basic principles that should guide our professional behavior throughout our education.\n\nClerkship Policy: The University of Washington School of Medicine takes pride in the vast array of clinical educational opportunities available to our students throughout the WWAMI region. Our Clerkship Policy enables students to take advantage of these opportunities. Students are expected to spend 24 weeks of their required clerkships outside of a 50-mile radius from Seattle, and regional or Spokane students spend a minimum of 8 weeks within Seattle. Exceptions to this policy are granted rarely.\n\nEssential Requirements: The M.D. degree is recognized as a broad, undifferentiated degree requiring the acquisition of general knowledge and basic skills in all fields of medicine. The education of a physician requires assimilation of knowledge, acquisition of skills and development of judgment through patient care experience in preparation for independent and appropriate decisions required in practice. There are numerous components to the UWSOM Essential Requirements of Medical Education: Admission, Retention, Promotion, and Graduation Standards. See the complete technical standards at: https://uwmedicine.org/education/Documents/TechnicalStandards.pdf\n\nUW Medicine Policy on Professional Conduct: UW Medicine is committed to high standards of professionalism in patient care, research and education among our faculty, staff, residents, fellows and students. Professionalism is integral to our mission of improving health, and includes demonstrating excellence, respect, integrity, compassion, altruism and accountability in all endeavors and creating an environment supportive of diversity in ideas, perspectives and experiences. Read the UW Medicine Policy on Professional Conduct at: https://www.uwmedicine.org/education/Documents/md-program/UWMedicinePolicyonProfessionalConduct.pdf\n\nApplicants are expected to communicate directly with the Admissions Office and the AAMC Choose Your Medical School Tool regarding their decision. On April 15, applicants must narrow medical school selections down to three. On April 30, applicants MUST select either “Commit to Enroll”, “Plan to Enroll”, or withdraw their application at the University of Washington. On July 12, applicants accepted to the program MUST select \"Commit to Enroll\" at the University of Washington in the AMCAS Application and withdraw their application from all other programs. If a decision is not reported by this date, it will be interpreted as a withdrawal. The UWSOM will not accept/enroll any applicant who chooses to \"Commit to Enroll\" at another institution. Alternates that have \"Commit to Enroll\" at another institution will not be accepted. Offers of admission will still be made to applicants that \"Plan to Enroll\" at another program."

Departmental advisors can answer questions about their specialties, the likelihood of you having a successful match, the rotations they recommend for your fourth year, and residencies to consider applying to. View the Career Advisors FAQ document for a list of the advisors, their contact information, and information about each specialty.\n\nCollege Mentors\nWith The Colleges Program at UW School of Medicine, each medical student is assigned a mentor to act as his or her advisor and advocate throughout their four years of medical school. In the first and second year, the focus is academic counseling. The focus shifts toward career counseling in the third and fourth years. Mentors are an important source of general information and guidance concerning careers in medicine. Some students have a clear idea of what fields they are interested in, but many students do not. Your mentor's role is to help you explore your interests, be a sounding board for ideas, and direct you to appropriate resources. Your mentor will not provide in-depth detailed information about applying to residencies or specific guidance on pursuing fields of medicine different from their own.\n\nStudent Affairs\nStaff members in student affairs can help you with questions about the residency application, the electronic residency application service (ERAS), and your Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE). Contact Sarah Wood in Student Affairs with questions."

In 1891 the school merged with the Faculté de Médecine of the Montreal branch of l'Université Laval, which had been founded in 1877. In 1920, by an act of the Quebec legislature, the Montreal branch of l'Université Laval was granted its independence, and the school of medicine became known by its present name. All instruction is in French, and clinical instruction is carried out at 16 affiliated teaching hospitals and research centers.",

The curriculum reverted to a four-year program in 1988 with a minimum two-year premedical requirement and now has been changed to a 4-year baccalaureate degree requirement beginning with entry fall of 2015. Clinical teaching is based at the Royal University, St. Paul's, and Saskatoon City Hospitals in Saskatoon, and the Regina General Hospital in Regina. Students also complete rotations in Saskatchewan Health Regions. The class size is 100 students.",

We seek students who want to change lives, transform health care and define the future of medicine. \n\nThe Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine Admissions Committee, composed of current and retired Mayo Clinic staff, current administrators, residents, and medical students, reviews all applications.\n\nThe committee considers these factors when selecting students:\n•Academic performance\n•MCAT score/percentile\n•GPA\n•Depth and breadth of all experiences, including community and volunteer service, leadership and research, exposure to and exploration of medicine, artistic and athletic endeavors, and work experiences\n•Personal statement\n•Letters of recommendation\n\nIn the primary application through AMCAS for the M.D. Program, applicants select their campus(es) of choice:\n•Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine — Minnesota campus\n•Mayo Clinic Alix School of Medicine — Arizona campus\n\nApplicants may apply to either or both campuses. There is a separate secondary fee for each campus. Applications are reviewed by separate campus admissions subcommittees. Deliberations and decisions are managed separately by each subcommittee. Campus location decisions are largely determined by the applicants and are not randomly assigned by committees.\n\nIf you are invited to submit a secondary application, you will have the opportunity to be considered for the Florida FOCUS (2+2) track. This select track allows students to spend their first two years based on either the Minnesota or Arizona campus and the final two years based on the Florida campus, which is known for its work in neuroscience, cancer, global health and health disparities.\n\nUp to twelve students from the total applicant pool will be selected for this option during the 2020 application cycle. Students begin their studies in either Minnesota or Arizona and then relocate to Florida prior to the 2022-2023 academic year.\n\nApplicants may:\n•Choose to be considered for the Florida FOCUS 2+2 track. If yes, then indicate order of preference. Applicants selecting the Florida 2+2 track as their first preference will receive priority consideration for review by the Florida Campus Admissions Subcommittee and a potential interview on the Florida campus.\n•Choose to not be considered for this track and only be considered for the four-year core program in Arizona and/or Minnesota.\n\nIn addition to the Florida 2+2 section on the secondary application, applicants must answer additional essay questions, verify completion of the required coursework and pay the secondary fee.\n\nInitial offers of acceptance (or appointment) will begin following the interview season, typically late January through mid-February. The wait list will be created by the end of February. Offers of acceptance from the wait list will be made until the first day of class in mid-July."

The students learn how basic research can be translated from bench-to-bedside or vice versa.  The emphasis is for medical students to identify health and treatment-related problems, study mechanisms to solve them by carrying out basic research, and take the knowledge back to the clinic.  Annually, this program will accept a select group of rising second-year medical students to participate.  The details of the RPMS program can be accessed at  http://school.med.sc.edu/",

By state mandate, enrollment of individuals who are residents of states other than Texas may not exceed 10 percent.\n\nThe Texas A&M College of Medicine participates in the Texas Medical and Dental Schools Application Service (TMDSAS). TMDSAS is a centralized application processing service for first-year applicants at participating medical schools. TMDSAS provides one standardized online form. Primary application to MD/PhD program is through AMCAS. The TMDSAS application has a flat fee of $165. All supporting documents should be uploaded or mailed to TMDSAS. In addition to mailing, letters of recommendation can be uploaded by the evaluator using the TMDSAS Advisor Portal, or electronically through Virtual Evals or Interfolio.\n\nThe secondary application is REQUIRED for both the MD, MD/PhD and EnMed educational programs and is in addition to the TMDSAS and/or AMCAS applications. The secondary application can be submitted before the TMDSAS or AMCAS application, provided the applicant has registered and created a TMDSAS and/or AMCAS account and has been issued an ID number. A nonrefundable $60 fee is required before the secondary application can be processed. Only credit cards are accepted for payment of the fee. Credit card payments must be made using the university's secure payment system.  Applicants will NOT be considered for evaluation until the primary and secondary applications have been properly completed and the secondary payment of $60 is received.  EnMed applicants in addition must submit the EnMed Supplemental. \n\nAll applicants to the Texas A&M University College of Medicine are required to complete a mandatory online 90-minute computer-based test (CASPer™) to assist with our selection process. Successful completion of CASPer is mandatory in order to maintain admission eligibility. CASPer is an online test which assesses for non-cognitive skills and interpersonal characteristics that we believe are important for successful students and graduates of our program, and will complement the other factors that we use for applicant screening. In implementing CASPer, we are trying to further enhance fairness and objectivity in our selection process.\n\nIn order to take CASPer, you will be responsible for securing access to a computer with audio capabilities, a webcam, and a reliable internet connection on your selected test date. CASPer can be taken practically anywhere that you can satisfy the aforementioned requirements. No exceptions will be provided for applicants unable to take CASPer online due to being located at sites where internet is not dependable due to technical or political factors.\n\nPlease go to www.takeCASPer.com to sign up and reserve a test using your TMDSAS or AMCAS Id # and a piece of government-issued photo ID or Driver’s License. You will be provided with a limited number of testing dates and times. Please note that these are the only testing dates available for your CASPer test. There will be no additional tests scheduled. Please use an email address that you check regularly; there may be updates to the test schedule."

We also have a two-week fourth year elective in translational research. While conducting research is not a requirement of the general MD curriculum (unless you're a student in the MD/PhD program), over 50% of our students feel that it's an important part of their learning process and involve themselves voluntarily in the research, both on-campus and off.",

Drexel offers a medical education rich in history and diversity, while providing the foundational curriculum and learning environment necessary for the scientific, technological, and ethical decisions required of physicians in the 21st century.",

Combined degree students complete the first 3 years of coursework in the MD degree program at HWCOM. At the beginning of the fourth period of study of the MD degree program curriculum, students admitted to the program pause their medical studies and begin classes as part of the MBA program. Classes in the MBA program are taken during fall and spring semesters of the medical student’s fourth year of study. During this time, students complete 33 hours of course work in the MBA program. Nine credits taken through HWCOM are applied toward the 42 credits required for the MBA degree. Students also must complete three program residencies (face-to-face/online). At the beginning of the fifth year, students resume study as part of the MD degree program curriculum. Students who successfully complete all requirements graduate with both degrees at the end of the 5 years.",

Using an innovative patient-centered curriculum, VTCSOM addresses the need for physicians who translate research from bench to bedside and into the community. The curriculum provides an exemplary education in basic and clinical sciences and skills, but transcends traditional medical education by providing a solid foundation in, and opportunities to explore, the disciplines of research and interprofessionalism. Our small class of 42 students allows for individualized attention, active participation by each student, and an intense and rewarding educational experience. We envision that VTC students will be highly sought after by residency programs and will become physician thought leaders in their chosen field of medicine.",

Our graduates will be physicians with outstanding clinical skills and significantly enhanced research capabilities who will remain life-long learners.

Students work closely with advisors and mentors over the course of their projects, and in the spring of their final year, in connection with the Buffmire Lecture series, present their findings via a scientific poster at the Scholarly Project Research Symposium, where students, staff, faculty, mentors and special guests view and discuss the posters with the graduating students. Some are chosen to make a brief presentation about their work.\n\nPrior projects: http://phoenixmed.arizona.edu/sp/presentations.",

Alternatively, letters may be sent to us from AMCAS as part of a \"letter packet\", or individually.

Before applying, you should review the admissions requirements of the SOM in order to verify that you will be able to meet the minimum requirements for admission. If you have questions, please feel free to contact us.\nSecondary Application\n•\tA Secondary Application is required for all. The Secondary Application fee is $80 and must be submitted with the application (unless waived due to participation in the AMCAS Fee Assistance Program). This additional application requires brief responses to three questions designed to gain a better understanding of their motivation to enter healthcare, as well as short-and long term goals. \nInterview\n•\tOnce your admissions application is complete it will be reviewed by our Admissions Committee. If after review the Admissions Committee deems you eligible to be interviewed, you will receive notification from our office with instructions on how to schedule an interview.\n•\tQualified applicants will be invited for an interview at SOM. An applicant will not be considered for an interview before their application is complete (please see the checklist below). The intent of the interview will be not only for SOM to learn about you, but also for you to learn about the SOM. The interviewer will strive to make the applicant comfortable asking questions and gathering information about the SOM. The ultimate goal of the interview will be to help both the SOM and you decide whether or not they are right for one another.\nCommittee Decisions\n•\tOffers of admission will be made on a rolling basis by e-mail.\n•\tAccepted applicants must respond within two weeks with their intention to accept or decline the offer of admission.\n•\tA deposit of $100 will be required to accept the offer; the deposit is refundable on or before April 30th.\n•\tAll offers of admission are conditional upon receiving final transcripts and all other required information including a satisfactory criminal background check."

Our M.D. program is designed to navigate today’s biggest health care challenges. We offer students a rare and exciting opportunity to be a part of a new model of teaching and practicing medicine.\n\nOur students won’t just memorize physiology, anatomy or the history of medicine. You’ll experience how these elements are interwoven using clinical cases and a team-based approach designed to help you understand the material and its context in patient care. Through this pedagogy, you will master a patient-first philosophy of care; communication and leadership; and the business side of the profession. We are here to educate innovative leaders.",

Applicants who do not meet 3 of 4 ties to the state (as defined on our website) must meet one of the legal definitions of WA resident student:  \n\n1) Applicants who are financially independent and have maintained a bona fide domicile in the state of Washington primarily for purposes other than educational for at least one year immediately prior to December 31 of the application year/January 1 of the enrollment year.\n2) Applicants who are financially dependent with at least one parent or legal guardian who has maintained a bona fide domicile in the state of Washington for at least one year immediately prior to December 31 of the application year/January 1 of the enrollment year.\n 3) Applicants who are on active military duty stationed in the state of Washington or are members of the Washington national guard.\n 4) Applicants who (i) are members of a federally recognized tribe whose traditional and customary tribal boundaries include portions of the state of Washington, or whose tribe was granted reserved lands within the state of Washington, and (ii) have maintained a bona fide domicile in Idaho, Montana, Oregon, or Washington or a combination of these states, for one year immediately prior to December 31 of the application year/January 1 of the enrollment year.\n\nApplicants who claim WA residency and do not meet the ties to the state will be required to submit documentation proving one of the definitions above. \n\nWe also established three threshold combinations of GPA and MCAT; we utilize the AMCAS calculated GPA. There are no exceptions to these thresholds. Once all secondary requirements have been met, an applicant will sent the secondary application. Upon return of the secondary, we blind MCAT and GPA from further review through the remainder of our process. From that point forward, we only consider experiences and attributes as they relate to our mission in deciding who we interview and accept."
